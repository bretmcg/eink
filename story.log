## 2026-01-22: Card Overlay Schema Refactor

Moved card overlay definitions from inline `backgroundImage` property to external JSON files.

**What changed:**
- Created `paper/overlays/` directory for overlay definitions
- Each overlay is now a standalone JSON file with `image`, `size`, and `elements` fields
- `card-design.js` loads overlay files asynchronously
- Backward compatible: designs using old `backgroundImage` property still work

**Files:**
- `paper/overlays/rascal-of-diamonds.json` (new)
- `paper/card-designs.json` (modified)
- `paper/card-design.js` (modified)
- `paper/new-design.md` (new) - documents how to add new designs

**Why:**
Prepares for Phase 2 (UI elements) and Phase 3 (custom JS overlays) by separating overlay concerns into dedicated files.
