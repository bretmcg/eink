# Sample Document

This is a sample document for testing the Paper theme picker.

## Introduction

E-ink displays have unique characteristics that require careful consideration when designing user interfaces. The high contrast ratio and lack of backlight make them ideal for reading, but the slow refresh rate means animations and rapid updates should be avoided.

## Key Principles

1. **Use pure black and white** - Avoid grays, they dither poorly
2. **Large touch targets** - E-ink screens often have stylus input
3. **Minimal animations** - Each screen refresh is visible
4. **High contrast** - Take advantage of the paper-like display

## Code Example

Here's a simple example:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Blockquote

> The best interface is no interface. The second best is one that looks like paper.

## Table

| Feature | E-Ink | LCD |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Contrast | Excellent | Good |
| Refresh | Slow | Fast |
| Eye strain | Low | Higher |
| Battery | Days | Hours |

## Conclusion

When designing for e-ink, embrace the constraints. The limitations lead to cleaner, more focused designs that are a joy to read.
