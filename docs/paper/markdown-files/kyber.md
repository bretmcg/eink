## II. ASSET COMPARISON

We are outgunned, but we are not outmaneuvered. Consult the tactical readout below.

| Spec | T-65 X-Wing | TIE/ln Fighter |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Manufacturer** | Incom Corp. | Sienar Fleet Systems |
| **Shielding** | Deflector Shields | ~~None~~ (Sentient Cargo Only) |
| **Hyperdrive** | Class 1.0 | N/A |
| **Crew** | 1 Pilot + 1 Astromech | 1 Pilot (Expendable) |

*Note: TIE Fighters rely on swarm tactics. Do not engage alone.*

## III. TECHNICAL SCHEMATICS

The following Python script was recovered from an Imperial Droid. It appears to control the thermal exhaust port shielding.

```python
def check_exhaust_port(torpedo_trajectory):
    port_width = 2.0 # meters
    shield_status = "ACTIVE"
    
    if torpedo_trajectory == "PERFECT":
        shield_status = "CRITICAL FAILURE"
        chain_reaction = True
        return "BOOM"
    else:
        return "IMPACT ON SURFACE"

# TODO: Patch this vulnerability before construction completes.
# - Galen Erso
```


The vulnerability is small. Approximately 2 meters wide. That's no bigger than a Womp Rat.
