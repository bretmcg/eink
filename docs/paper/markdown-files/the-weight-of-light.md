# The Weight of Light

There is a quality to afternoon light in late autumn that photographers call "golden hour," but which I have come to think of as something else entirely: the hour of weight. The sun, hanging low, projects shadows that stretch across rooms like the long memories of summer. The light itself seems heavy, syrupy, reluctant to move.

I think about light often, now that I spend my days staring at screens that generate their own. The irony is not lost on me. I write about presence while bathed in the pale blue glow of liquid crystals. I advocate for attention while my phone buzzes with notifications. This is the condition of our age: to know better and to do otherwise.

## The Paradox of Illumination

The screen you are reading this on—assuming you are reading this on a screen—is a small sun. It emits photons directly into your eyes at frequencies our ancestors only experienced by looking at the sky. We have brought daylight indoors, made it portable, held it in our hands. We check it first thing in the morning and last thing at night. We have become a species of sun-gazers.

> "We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us." This line, often attributed to Marshall McLuhan, captures something essential about our relationship with technology. But it doesn't go far enough.

We don't just shape our tools. We enter into relationships with them. We make promises. We develop dependencies that we mistake for love and habits that we mistake for necessity. The tool becomes invisible, like water to a fish, and we forget that we are swimming.

Consider the book. Not the e-book, not the audiobook, but the physical codex that has remained essentially unchanged for five hundred years. It requires no battery. It makes no demands. It waits. When you pick it up, it is exactly as you left it, the bookmark holding your place with patient fidelity. There are no updates, no notifications, no algorithmic suggestions about what you should read next.

### The Texture of Pages

I keep a notebook by my bed. Not a device that happens to have a notes application—a paper notebook with pages that yellow slightly at the edges, that remember the pressure of the pen, that fall open naturally to frequently visited pages. There is a word for this quality of remembering through use: *patina*. Digital objects do not develop patina. They are always new, always the same, until suddenly they are obsolete.

This is not nostalgia. I am not interested in going backward. I am interested in going deeper—in understanding what we have traded away and what we have gained, so that we can make the exchange consciously rather than by default.

## The Economy of Attention

In 1971, Herbert Simon wrote:

> In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients.

This was before the personal computer. Before the internet. Before the smartphone. Simon, an economist and cognitive scientist, understood something that would take the rest of us decades to feel in our bones: attention is finite. It is the only resource that cannot be manufactured, stored, or borrowed. When it is spent, it is gone.

The technology industry discovered this truth and built an empire on it. The business model is elegant in its simplicity: capture attention, sell it to advertisers. The more attention captured, the more revenue generated. This creates an arms race of engagement, an escalating competition for the minutes and hours of human consciousness.

Here is a partial inventory of what competes for your attention at this very moment:

- The device in your pocket (or hand)
- The tabs open in your browser
- The emails awaiting response
- The messages accumulating in various apps
- The news, always breaking, never finished
- The social feeds, algorithmically tuned to your vulnerabilities
- The streaming libraries, infinite and overwhelming
- The podcasts, piling up like unread magazines
- The audiobooks, the courses, the tutorials
- The subscription boxes, the newsletters, the notifications

And beneath all of these, the persistent hum of obligation: the sense that you should be doing something else, that you are falling behind, that somewhere someone is optimizing their morning routine while you lie in bed scrolling.

## The Practice of Refusal

I have been experimenting with what I call *strategic friction*: the deliberate introduction of obstacles between myself and the easiest path. This is not productivity advice. I am not interested in optimizing my life. I am interested in living it.

Some examples:

### The Notebook Method

For anything that matters—ideas, reflections, plans—I write by hand first. The slowness is the point. The pen moves at the speed of thought, not faster. There is no copy-paste, no delete key, no infinite revision. What appears on the page stays on the page, crossed out if necessary, a visible record of thinking in progress.

### The Distance Principle

My phone lives in a drawer when I am working. Not on the desk face-down. Not in my pocket on silent. In a drawer, in another room if possible. The goal is not to resist temptation but to remove it. We overestimate our willpower and underestimate our environment.

### The Single-Tab Rule

When I need to focus, I use a browser extension that allows only one tab at a time. The violence this does to my usual workflow is instructive. I discover how often I open new tabs reflexively, how addicted I have become to the small dopamine hit of *maybe something new*.

These practices are not prescriptions. They are experiments. What works for me may not work for you. The point is not the specific technique but the underlying recognition: our environments are designed to capture our attention, and if we do not design counter-environments, we will be captured.

## The Quality of Time

Not all hours are equal. We know this intuitively but forget it in practice. An hour of focused work is worth four hours of distracted work. An hour of genuine rest is worth a day of anxious pseudo-relaxation. An hour of presence with someone you love is worth—I don't know what it's worth. Some things exceed measurement.

The Greeks had two words for time: *chronos* and *kairos*. Chronos is clock time, sequential time, the time of schedules and deadlines. Kairos is qualitative time, the right time, the moment of opportunity or significance. We have become experts at measuring chronos and nearly blind to kairos.

| Chronos | Kairos |
|---------|--------|
| Quantity | Quality |
| Measured | Experienced |
| Sequential | Meaningful |
| Scarce | Deep |
| Productivity | Presence |

The attention economy deals only in chronos. It measures engagement in minutes, quantifies attention in clicks, optimizes for time-on-site. But the moments that matter most in our lives—the conversations that change us, the insights that reorder our understanding, the experiences that we carry forever—these happen in kairos. They cannot be scheduled or optimized. They can only be made possible.

## The Weight of Light, Revisited

I began with light. Let me end there.

There is a reason we speak of *spending* time and *paying* attention. These metaphors reveal our assumptions. We treat time and attention as currencies, as resources to be allocated efficiently. But what if they are not resources at all? What if they are more like light—something that illuminates but also has weight, that reveals but also demands something of us?

> The quality of light by which we scrutinize our lives has direct bearing upon the product which we live, and upon the changes which we hope to bring about through those lives.

These words are Adrienne Rich's. She was writing about poetry, but she might as well have been writing about attention. The light we choose—the screens we stare at, the pages we turn, the faces we look into—shapes not just what we see but who we become.

This is the weight of light: every photon carries a choice. We cannot attend to everything. To say yes to one thing is to say no to a thousand others. The question is not how to see more but how to see well. Not how to consume more information but how to let ourselves be informed, in the old sense of the word: *in-formed*, shaped from within.

I am writing this on an e-ink screen. The light is ambient, reflected, like a page. There is something right about this. Not because it is natural—the technology is profoundly artificial—but because it reminds me that there are choices. That the way we read and write and think today is not inevitable but constructed. That we can construct it differently.

The afternoon light is fading now. The shadows have grown long and merged into dusk. Soon I will need a lamp, or I will need to stop. This too is a kind of gift: the constraint of darkness, the invitation to rest, the weight of light finally lifting.

In the old days, before electric light, the rhythm of reading followed the rhythm of the sun. People gathered around fires, around candles, around the single bright window. Reading was a communal act, or a deliberate one—you had to want it enough to arrange the conditions for it.

We have gained much by escaping those constraints. But we have lost something too: the sense that light is precious, that attention is finite, that not everything needs to be illuminated all the time.

Perhaps this is what I am reaching for: a life with more shadow in it. Not darkness—shadow. The places where the light does not reach, where things can remain hidden, where not everything is visible and optimized and on display.

In the shadow, things grow. In the shadow, there is rest. In the shadow, we remember that we are not only eyes but also the ones who close them.
