To achieve the absolute "Still" experience on your **Boox Go 10.3**—which is arguably the best device for this due to the 300 PPI glass-free screen—you need to strip away the "Android-ness" of the software.

Since the Go 10.3 lacks a backlight, you are relying entirely on the **Ink** quality. Here is the configuration to turn NeoReader into a "Still" canvas.

### 1. The "Still" Refresh Mode

Standard Android refresh modes (Speed, A2, X-Mode) are the enemy of Slate. They use dithering and "shimmer" to simulate movement.

- **Mode:** **HD Mode** or **Regal Mode**.
    
- **Why:** HD Mode provides the highest fidelity (300 PPI). Regal Mode is specifically designed to clear ghosting without a full-screen flash.1
    
- **Setting:** Swipe down for the Control Center > **E-Ink Center** > Set Refresh Mode to **HD**.
    

### 2. Kill the Interface (The "Blank Slate" UI)

You want the hardware bezel to be the only border you see.

- **Hide Status Bar:** Open a PDF > Tap center for Menu > **Settings (Hamburger icon)** > **Global Settings** > Toggle **OFF** "Enable Reading Status Bar."
    
- **Hide Floating Toolbar:** Settings > **Floating Toolbar Settings** > Toggle **OFF** "Enable Floating Toolbar."2
    
- **Hide Page Progress:** Settings > **Global Settings** > Toggle **OFF** "Show Page Number/Progress."
    

### 3. Disable All Movement (Touch & Animation)

NeoReader is "Still" by default, but gestures can trigger "Sliding" animations.

- **Page Turn Animation:** Settings > **User Settings** > Ensure "Page Turn Animation" is set to **None**. (If you tap to turn, the page should simply _exist_ on the next frame with no sliding).
    
- **Tap Zones:** Settings > **Touch Settings**. Set the entire screen to "Tap to Page Turn" rather than "Swipe." Swiping introduces a vector of movement; tapping is a binary state change.
    

### 4. Optimize the "Ink" (The .ink Standard)

Since you are on a non-backlight device, contrast is your only tool for legibility.

- **Contrast:** Tap center > **Contrast (Moon/Sun icon)**.
    
    - Set **Dark Color Enhancement** to `35` (makes text "Stained" black).
        
    - Set **Light Color Filter** to `0` (preserves the "Paper" gray of the E-Ink).
        
- **Sharpening:** Under the "Style" tab, ensure **Image Sharpening** is enabled if the PDF is a scan, but disabled for vector PDFs to keep the edges perfectly "flat."

### The "Slate" Result

When you finish this setup:

1. You will see **nothing** but the PDF text. No clocks, no bars, no icons.
    
2. When you tap the right side of the device, the screen will hold perfectly still for a millisecond, then the new text will appear.
    
3. Because you have no backlight and no BSR (Big Screen Refresh) chip, there is **zero** electronic noise. It is just physical particles of carbon rearranged on a film.
    

**Would you like me to show you how to set the "Side Gestures" on the Boox so that a long-swipe from the left acts as your "Dramatic Refresh" to clear the screen entirely?**
