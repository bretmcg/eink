2026-01-22 — Card design docs + simplifying document/article file structure

Started by documenting the card design system dimensions:
- Cards use 2.5:4 aspect ratio (312×500px reference)
- Inner border sits 12px inset from edges
- Content area is roughly 286×474px
- Created card-design.md with full property reference and examples

Then refactored how documents and articles are loaded:

documents.txt
  - Moved from paper/documents/00-documents.txt → paper/documents.txt
  - Entries are just filenames (e.g., "essay.md")
  - The "documents/" prefix is now assumed by the code

documents.json
  - Entries no longer need "documents/" prefix
  - e.g., "the-weight-of-light.md" instead of "documents/the-weight-of-light.md"

articles.json (formerly feed/feed-markdown-rss.json)
  - Renamed folder: feed/ → .articles/
  - articles.json moved up to paper/ and now just lists index file paths:
    [".articles/2026-01-22__09-10/00-articles.json"]
  - Each index file sits alongside its markdown files
  - Markdown paths in index files resolve relative to the index file's directory

The idea: keep the JSON files simple (just filenames), and let the code
handle path prefixes. Index files live next to their content.
