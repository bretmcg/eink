Most newsletter growth advice comes from people who’ve only ever grown newsletters *about* newsletters.

I did something different. I built a health Substack from zero to 40,000 subscribers in three months - as a medical doctor writing about neuroscience, not as a creator writing about creating.

Here’s what I learned: the ideal short-form post does three things:

1. **Stops the scroll** (hook)
2. **Creates an emotional reason to share**
3. **Signals why** ***you*** **are worth following**

### 1. The Hook

A hook has **one job**:

> **Stop someone mid-scroll long enough for the rest of the post to matter.**

That’s it.

In short-form writing, you’re not competing with other health or science creators.  
You’re competing with group chats, bad news, memes, and someone else’s dog video.

If the first line doesn’t interrupt that stream - even briefly - nothing else gets read.

A few formats that work:

* **Credential hooks:** “Speaking as a neuroscientist:” - instantly answers *why should I listen to you?*
* **Pattern interrupts:** “Unfortunately, diet, exercise, and 8 hours of sleep DOES dramatically improve your life.” - the “unfortunately” creates tension.
* **Nostalgia hooks:** “Our grandparents were onto something.” - warm, familiar, makes you want to know what comes next.
* **Soft commands:** “Reminder:” - positions what follows as something you already knew but forgot.

**Where to find hooks that actually work:**

Create a spreadsheet or note with 50-100 high-performing tweets in your niche. Health, wellness, psychology, medicine - whatever your corner is. Look for posts with disproportionate engagement (high retweets relative to follower count).

Then analyse them:

* What’s the first line?
* What emotion does it trigger? (Curiosity? Recognition? Nostalgia? Validation?)
* What format is it? (List? Story? Reframe? Quote?)

You’ll start seeing patterns. “Reminder:” works. “Nobody talks about:” works. “I’ve been a [credential] for X years:” works.

You’re not copying. You’re learning the grammar of what stops a scroll in your specific world.

Most health creators skip this step and wonder why their “correct but boring” content dies. The information isn’t the problem. The packaging is.
