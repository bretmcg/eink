**Nobody cares about your writing.**

I know that stings. But if you’re thinking about launching a paid newsletter - or watching one flatline - this is the truth you need to hear.

Readers don’t pay for words. They pay for value exchange. They pay for problems solved.

The writers who treat their paid newsletter like a blog with a paywall? They struggle. The writers who treat it like a book that never ends are the ones who actually succeed.

### **The 4-Point Stress Test**

Before you write a single word, run your idea through these four questions. Be brutally honest. If you’re missing even one, you’re asking readers to pay for something they won’t value.

#### **1. Is it Infinitely Repeatable?**

Can you write about this topic forever?

Neuroscience and brain health are perfect for paid newsletters because new research drops every week. There’s always a new study on sleep, cognition, neuroplasticity, or mental performance to break down.

Contrast this with something like “How to Meditate.” I once considered a paid newsletter on meditation basics, but realised the core techniques don’t change much year to year. It wasn’t dynamic enough to justify a monthly bill.

If you run out of things to say after three issues, it’s not a subscription.

#### **2. Is it Tangible?**

Information alone feels weightless. Readers hesitate to pay for concepts they can’t apply.

Every issue needs a deliverable: a weekly protocol, a breakdown of a specific study with practical takeaways, a checklist, a supplement guide based on the latest research.

When I write about neuroplasticity, I don’t just explain the science - I give subscribers specific things they can do and implement immediately. People pay for tools, not theory.

#### **3. Is the Outcome Objective?**

Stop selling subjective outcomes.

Subjective: “I will help you be more productive.”

Objective: “7 neuroscience-backed techniques to improve your focus.”

When your outcome is specific, readers can instantly picture themselves achieving it.

#### **4. Is it Price Anchored?**

Anchor your price against the cost of not solving the problem.

Imagine your reader is a burned-out professional spending $300/month on nootropic supplements they found on Reddit, hoping something sticks.

“Stop guessing with your brain health. For $15/month, I’ll tell you exactly which supplements have peer-reviewed evidence - and which are a waste of money.”

Your newsletter isn’t an expense anymore. It’s a savings mechanism.
