Most people obsess over subscriber count. But subscriber count is an output - the end result of a chain of events. It tells you where you are, not why you’re there or how to move forward.

When growth stalls, you need to know which part of the system is broken. Are people not seeing your Notes? Seeing them but not engaging? Engaging but not following or subscribing?

Each is a different problem with a different solution. Track the wrong metrics and you’ll waste months fixing things that aren’t broken.

## The Subscriber Formula: A Funnel, Not a Mystery

Every subscriber you gain through Notes goes through the same journey. No exceptions.

**Step 1: Impression** — Someone sees your Note in their feed.

**Step 2: Engagement** — They find it valuable enough to like, reply, or restack.

**Step 3: Profile Click** — Something makes them curious enough to check out your profile or publication.

**Step 4: Subscribe** — What they see matches what they’re looking for, so they subscribe.

This isn’t just a sequence. It’s a multiplicative formula:

**Subscribers Gained = Impressions × Engagement Rate × Profile Click Rate × Subscribe Rate**

In multiplication, if any number is zero, the entire result is zero. If any number is small, it drags down everything else.

Say you get 50,000 impressions this week. But only 1% engage (500). Only 2% of those click your profile (10 visits). Only 20% subscribe. You gained 2 subscribers from 50,000 impressions.

Now imagine someone with 10,000 impressions - but 4% engage (400), 10% click through (40 visits), and 30% subscribe (12 new subscribers). They grew 6x faster with one-fifth the reach.

This is why “just post more Notes” is incomplete advice. If your conversion rates are broken, more impressions just means more wasted potential.

**Where to find these numbers:** All four metrics - impressions, engagements, profile clicks, and new subscribers - **are available per Note in the** **Substack app (tap any Note → View Stats)**. **Desktop only shows basic engagement counts.**

> **Important:** Substack doesn't share official benchmarks for Notes metrics. The numbers below are based on my own data and creator conversations. Use them as starting points, but the real power is tracking **your own performance** week over week. Your baseline is the only benchmark that matters.

## The Things You Should Actually Track

These metrics map directly to the subscriber formula. Track them weekly and you’ll always know what’s working and what needs fixing.

### 1. Impressions

**What it measures:** How many times your Notes were displayed. This is pure visibility - how many people had the chance to see your content. Substack counts unique users per Note, so if one person sees your Note three times, it counts as one impression.

**Where to find it:** Tap any Note → View Stats (available ONLY in the Substack app). You’ll see impressions over time and **how they compare to your average.**

**If impressions are low compared to your average, common causes include:**

* Posting at times when your audience isn’t active
* The algorithm hasn’t clustered you yet (inconsistent topics)
* The topic doesn't resonate with your audience or the broader Substack network

**Quick fixes:** Increase Note frequency. Post when your audience is online (test different times and track results). Stay consistent in your topic so the algorithm understands who to show your content to.

### 2. Engagement Rate

**What it measures:** Of people who saw your Note, how many interacted with it.

**Formula:** (Likes + Replies + Restacks) ÷ Impressions × 100

**Where to find it:** Calculate manually from Note stats. Add up likes, replies, and restacks, then divide by impressions.
