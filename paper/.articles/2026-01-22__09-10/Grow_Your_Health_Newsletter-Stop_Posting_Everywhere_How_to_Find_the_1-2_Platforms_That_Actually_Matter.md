Most newsletter writers post content and hope the right people find it.

That is not a strategy. That is a lottery ticket.

The real question is: *Where does your audience already spend their time online?*

I have nearly 20k followers on [Twitter/X](https://x.com/DrDominicNg) and 16k on [Threads](https://www.threads.com/@drdominic.ng). I believe about half of my paid subscribers came from these two platforms. Two weeks ago, a single thread I posted hit 3.8 million views.

That did not happen by accident. It happened because I understood where my readers gather - and I showed up there consistently.

Here is exactly how to find the right platforms for your health newsletter.

### **1. Go to Your Audience (They Will Not Come to You)**

Most writers pick a platform because it is popular. They heard “TikTok is blowing up” or “LinkedIn is great for newsletters,” so they start posting there.

This is backwards.

The question is not *“What platform is growing?”* The question is *“Where does my specific audience already spend their time?”*

If your readers are busy professionals interested in longevity, they are probably not scrolling TikTok at 2pm. If your readers are women over 40 looking for hormone advice, they might be in Facebook groups, not on LinkedIn.

You are not building an audience from scratch. You are finding where your audience already gathers and inserting yourself into that conversation.

### **2. Find the Overlap: Where You Spend Time AND Where Your Audience Is**

Here is a mistake I see constantly: writers force themselves onto platforms they hate because someone told them “that’s where the growth is.”

They burn out in two months.

The sustainable approach is finding the overlap - platforms where your audience already spends time AND where you are comfortable showing up consistently.

#### **Every Platform Has a Culture**

Each platform has its own in-jokes, unwritten rules, and indefinable feel. The tone that works on X does not work on Instagram. The posts that thrive on Reddit would flop on LinkedIn.

For example: X has a strong “rationalist” streak, especially in health and science spaces. People share studies. Substack is different. The culture is more personal, more narrative. Readers expect depth and storytelling, not just data points.

**If you already spend time on a platform, you have already absorbed its culture.** You understand the tone. You know what feels right. You can spot a post that “fits” versus one that feels off.

But that is just one half of the equation. **The other half is making sure your audience is actually there.**

Here is how to research this:

#### **Method 1: Search for Active Communities**

Open Reddit, Facebook, and X. Search for your health topic. Look for:

* Subreddits with 10k+ members and daily posts
* Facebook groups with active discussions (not ghost towns)
* Hashtags on X where people engage, not just broadcast

Write down the 5 most active communities you find.

#### **Method 2: Research Successful Health Writers**

Find 3–5 health newsletter writers in your niche who have strong followings. Note:

* Which platforms are they active on?
* Where do they get the most engagement?
* Where do they link back to their newsletter?

If multiple successful writers in your niche are growing on the same platform, that is a signal.
