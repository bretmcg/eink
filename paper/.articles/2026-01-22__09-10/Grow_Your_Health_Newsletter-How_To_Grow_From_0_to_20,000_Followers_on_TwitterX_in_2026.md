Seven months ago I had zero followers on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/DrDominicNg) and no idea what I was doing.

I didn’t know how the algorithm worked. I didn’t know what to post. I didn’t know that replying mattered more than posting when you’re starting out. I just knew I wanted to grow an audience around neuroscience and brain health.

Today I have [21,000 followers](https://x.com/DrDominicNg), multiple posts over 1 million views, and I’ve earned roughly $2,000 from X’s creator ad revenue program.

This is the guide I wish someone had handed me on day one.

### **Step 1: Get Clear on Your Niche Before You Post Anything**

A lot of people get this wrong because they start posting about whatever interests them that day. Politics on Monday. Fitness on Tuesday. A random meme on Wednesday.

Here’s what you need to understand: the algorithm *wants* to help you. Its job is to connect your content with people who would find it interesting. But if you’re posting about random topics, it doesn’t know who to show your posts to.

**Try to think of your account like a clothesline.**

The line itself is your core theme - the one thing you’re known for. Everything you post should hang off that line. Some posts might be slightly different shapes or colours, but they’re all attached to the same rope.

### **Step 2: Fix Your Bio and Profile**

Your bio needs to answer one question in three seconds: “Is this for me?”

It needs three elements:

* Who you are (your credibility)
* What you share (your topic)
* Why it matters (the outcome for them)

“Neuroscientist sharing evidence-based ways to improve your brain health” works. It tells you my credentials, my topic, and the benefit to you.

“Curious thinker exploring ideas” does not work. It tells you nothing.

Also, your profile picture should be your face - people connect with people.

### **Step 3: Build an Engagement List and Reply Consistently**

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_DzN!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9b88db4-4a3b-4c40-82ee-79fdeea0bb3c_648x152.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_DzN!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9b88db4-4a3b-4c40-82ee-79fdeea0bb3c_648x152.png)

Identify 10-15 of the top performing accounts in your niche. These are people with engaged followers who talk about what you want to talk about.

Follow them and organise them into a list. Then build a habit around this list. I log in at 1pm, switch to my list, and reply to recent posts from those accounts. This is my routine.

When you leave a good reply on a big account’s post, hundreds or thousands of people see it. Some will click your profile. If your bio is clear and your content is strong, they’ll follow. This is how you get discovered when you’re starting from nothing.

**X also promotes your own posts more when you interact with others.** The platform rewards engagement. So replies aren’t just about visibility - they’re helping your own content perform better too.

A good reply does one of these things:

* Adds your own perspective or experience
* Shares relevant information they didn’t mention
* Asks a genuine question that moves the conversation forward
* Respectfully challenges something with reasoning

“Great post!” adds nothing.

A warning: do not get sucked into the main feed. The algorithm is designed to keep you scrolling. Use the list, do your replies, get out.

### **Step 4: Create a Pinned Post**

Pin your best performing post to your profile.

When someone clicks through from a reply, this is the first thing they see. If a post has already gone viral or performed well, it’s proven. Let it keep working for you.

If you're just starting out and have nothing yet, write an introduction. Who you are. What you'll be sharing. Why you're worth following. Keep it simple and direct. You can swap it out later once you have a post that takes off.
