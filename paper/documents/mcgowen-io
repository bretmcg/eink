# BRAND BOOTSTRAP: McGowen Craftworks

**Domain:** `mcgowen.io`
**Established:** 2025
**Location:** New York / The Cloud / Wherever there is Wi-Fi

## 1. The Core Identity

**McGowen Craftworks** is a digital forge building human-centric, open-source software. We are an Engineering Management studio that believes software should be helpful, not needy.

We operate at the intersection of "Hardcore Engineering" and "Please let me finish my coffee in peace." We reject the "move fast and break things" ethos in favor of "move intentionally and build things that actually work."

### The Vibe

* **Visuals:** A dusty Renaissance guild hall, vellum schematics, and serious craftsmanship. Think Leonardo da Vinci sketching a React component tree.
* **Voice:** The clever Guildmaster who winks at you while handing you a perfectly balanced sword. Smart, competent, empathetic, and slightly irreverent about the tech industry.

### The Values (Our Manifesto)

1. **Human First (No, Really):** We build tools for actual people, not "Daily Active Users" metrics. If our app helps you finish your work faster so you can close the tab and go outside, we consider that a massive victory.
2. **Open Source / Open Kimono:** We show our work. You can read our code on GitHub. If we mess up, you’ll see that too. Radical transparency is the only way to build long-term trust in a digital world.
3. **Calm Down:** Technology screams at us all day. We build "Calm Tech"—apps like e-ink readers and voice catchers that do the job without demanding a dopamine hit every twelve seconds.
4. **Craft over Cruft:** We prefer elegant, maintainable architecture over shiny new features that will break next Tuesday. We build for longevity.

## 2. Voice & Tone

Our voice is **Cheeky, Clever, and Empathetic.**

* **The Golden Rule:** We take the work very seriously, but we never take *ourselves* seriously.
* **We sound like:** A senior engineer who has "seen some shit," loves the craft deeply, but hates corporate jargon with the fire of a thousand suns.
* **Do:** Be witty. Use physical metaphors for digital things. Break the fourth wall. Acknowledge that computers are often frustrating garbage fires.
* **Don't:** Be condescending or cynical. Never use "Growth Hacking" terminology. Do not sound like a ChatGPT-generated press release.

**Examples of the Voice in Action:**

* *The Boring Way:* "Our new application leverages advanced voice recognition APIs to increase user productivity."
* *The Craftworks Way:* "Don't type. Just talk. We'll catch the words so you can keep walking to get your coffee."
* *The Boring Way:* "We value user privacy and data security."
* *The Craftworks Way:* "We don't want your data. Honestly, we wouldn't know what to do with it if we had it. Your secrets are safe because we aren't listening."
* *The Boring Way:* "Subscribe to our newsletter for updates."
* *The Craftworks Way:* "Join the Guild. We email once a month, usually when we actually have something to say."

## 3. Visual Identity System: "The Digital Study"

The visual aesthetic is the "Straight Man" to our "Funny Voice." The look must be grounded, highly textural, and scream high-quality to prove we are competent.

### Color Palette

A warm, inviting, "Dark Academia" palette that feels easy on the eyes.

* **Canvas:** `Warm Alabaster` / `#F2F0E9` (Like unbleached parchment or good cardstock).
* **Ink:** `Deep Midnight` / `#2C3E50` (Our standard text color. High contrast, but softer than harsh black).
* **Leather:** `Muted Terracotta` / `#C07D55` (For primary buttons and accents. A color you want to touch).
* **Sage:** `Desaturated Green` / `#8F9E8B` (For success states and nature motifs. "It worked, relax.")
* **Gold Leaf:** `Muted Metallic` / `#D4AF37` (Use sparingly for borders or premium accents. We aren't royalty, just artisans).

### Typography Pairing

* **Headings (The Tome):** *Merriweather*, *EB Garamond*, or *Spectral*. (Something that looks right printed on old paper).
* **Body/UI/Code (The Tech):** *Fira Code*, *JetBrains Mono*, or *Inconsolata*. (A monospace font that reminds them we actually write Python and TypeScript).

## 4. Naming Conventions

We use "Guild-flavored" names for our internal assets and products, but we describe them with a wink.

* **The Blog:** "The Ledger" (Subtitle: *Mistakes were made, lessons were learned.*)
* **Portfolio/Case Studies:** "The Armory" or "Blueprints."
* **About Us Page:** "The Guildhall."
* **Contact Page:** "Send a Raven" (or just "Hiring").

**Product Concept Names:**

* *Scribe* (A dictation/voice app).
* *Quietus* (An e-ink or distraction-free reading tool).
* *Flux* (A project management or brainstorming tool).

## AI ASSET GENERATION PROMPT

**Copy and paste the block below into Midjourney, DALL-E 3, or a similar tool to kickstart your visual brand assets.**

> I need a set of brand assets for a new company called "McGowen Craftworks."
> **THE BRAND CONTEXT:**
> McGowen Craftworks is a boutique software studio. The vibe is "Witty Artificer" or "Digital Guild." It combines the aesthetic of high-quality, old-world craftsmanship (leather, ink, parchment, schematics) with a modern, clever, human-centric technology philosophy. It should look highly professional and expensive, but feel full of personality—like a D&D Guild Hall that happens to ship open-source Python code.
> **THE AESTHETIC:**
> **Colors:** Cream/off-white parchment backgrounds, deep charcoal ink, terracotta orange/leather, and sage green.
> **Style:** Letterpress printing textures, hand-drawn technical schematics, Leonardo Da Vinci-style notebook sketches of modern computer parts (like a GPU rendered as a clockwork mechanism).
> **REQUESTED ASSETS:**
> 1. **Main Logo Emblem:** A circular, stamp-style mark. It should combine a traditional "Maker's Tool" (like a fountain pen nib or a drafting compass) with a modern "Tech Symbol" (like a network node, a microchip, or a command prompt cursor `>_`). The style should look like an etched woodcut print.
> 2. **Wordmark:** The words "McGOWEN CRAFTWORKS" in a bold, slightly weathered, classic Serif font. Below it, smaller, the tagline: "HAND-FORGED SOFTWARE".
> 3. **Website Hero Background:** A top-down photographic view of a "Modern Wizard's Desk." Objects include: An open MacBook Pro displaying code (but the laptop is covered in a custom leather skin), a heavy brass mechanical keyboard, a quill pen next to a tablet stylus, a ceramic cup of coffee, and an open notebook filled with hand-drawn UI diagrams. The lighting is warm, cozy, and natural.
> 4. **Social Icon:** A stylized letter "M" that looks like it was branded into wood or stamped in wax.
