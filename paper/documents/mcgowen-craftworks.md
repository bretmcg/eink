# Hand-Forged Software for a Quieter World.
### We build tools that help you do your work—so you can close your laptop and go outside.

### [The Pitch]

**McGowen Craftworks** is a digital forge operating out of New York City and the Cloud.

We are an Engineering Management studio that rejects the "move fast and break things" ethos in favor of "move intentionally and build things that actually work."

We sit at the intersection of **Hardcore Engineering** and **"Please let me finish my coffee in peace."**

### [What We Do]

#### 🛠️ Engineering Management
We don't just write code; we herd cats. We bring seasoned leadership to chaotic technical teams, turning "agile" nightmares into predictable, happy delivery cycles.

#### 📜 Calm Technology
The world is loud enough. We specialize in building "Calm Tech"—applications that respect your attention span, protect your privacy, and don't demand a dopamine hit every 14 seconds.

#### ⚔️ Open Source Artificery
We believe in radical transparency. We show our work. You can read our code. If we mess up, you’ll see that too. It’s the only way to build trust in a digital world.

### [The Founder's Note]
*(A.K.A. The "Rascally" Bio)*

## Hello from the Guildmaster.

I’m **Bret McGowen**.

I’ve spent years in the trenches of software engineering—from the frantic energy of startups to the towering server racks of the enterprise. I’ve seen the good, the bad, and the "why is this database query taking 45 seconds?"

Somewhere along the way, the tech industry lost the plot. We started building software to glue eyeballs to screens instead of solving actual human problems. We traded craftsmanship for "growth hacking."

**I started McGowen Craftworks to fix that.**

Think of this studio as a digital woodshop. I love the smell of fresh sawdust (or in my case, a clean Python build). I believe that code should be elegant, documentation should be readable, and that a "User" is actually a **Human Being** who is probably late for a meeting and just needs the app to work.

When I’m not forging software, I’m likely exploring New York, getting lost in a Brandon Sanderson novel, or trying to find a sandwich that doesn’t have onions on it.

Welcome to the guild.

**— Bret**

## PAGE: ABOUT / THE MANIFESTO

### 1. Human First (No, Really)
We build tools for people, not metrics. If our app helps you finish your task faster so you can log off, we consider that a victory.

### 2. Craft over Cruft
We prefer maintainable, boring architecture over the "JavaScript Framework of the Week" that will break next Tuesday. We build for longevity.

### 3. Open Kimono
We don't want your data. Honestly, we wouldn't know what to do with it if we had it. Your secrets are safe because we aren't listening.
